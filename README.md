# binary-addition-machine
Python implementation of a binary addition machine using boolean logic.

Creation of this code was inspired by reading the book [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software). To help better internalise the concepts I decided to implement them in code.
